Currently intending to do 1 byte OPCode
Then each instruction can specify how many bytes its supposed to send2wheels
Each of the wheel operations only need 1 byte as their values are currently intended to be 0-255
Implementation actually works on basis of 0-180 where 90 is a halt,
 it internally converts to the correct signal for wheel speed.

OpCode Ideas:
0 both sets of wheels
1 left wheels
2 right wheels
